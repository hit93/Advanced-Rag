The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps.

The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}), Document(page_content='Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.
